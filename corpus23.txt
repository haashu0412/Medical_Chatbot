Overview

Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). By damaging your immune system, HIV interferes with your body's ability to fight infection and disease.

HIV is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). It can also be spread by contact with infected blood or from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breast-feeding. Without medication, it may take years before HIV weakens your immune system to the point that you have AIDS .

There's no cure for HIV / AIDS , but medications can dramatically slow the progression of the disease. These drugs have reduced AIDS deaths in many developed nations.

Symptoms

This illness, known as primary (acute) HIV infection has symptos like Fever,Headache,Muscle aches and joint pain,Rash,Sore throat and painful mouth sores,Swollen lymph glands, mainly on the neck,Diarrhea,Weight loss,Cough,Night sweats,Oral yeast infection (thrush),Shingles (herpes zoster)

Progression to AIDS

Thanks to better antiviral treatments, most people with HIV in the U.S. today don't develop AIDS . Untreated, HIV typically turns into AIDS in about 8 to 10 years.

When AIDS occurs, your immune system has been severely damaged. You'll be more likely to develop opportunistic infections or opportunistic cancers — diseases that wouldn't usually cause illness in a person with a healthy immune system.

The signs and symptoms of some of these infections may include:

Sweats

Chills

Recurring fever

Chronic diarrhea

Swollen lymph glands

Persistent white spots or unusual lesions on your tongue or in your mouth

Persistent, unexplained fatigue

Weakness

Weight loss

Skin rashes or bumps

When to see a doctor

If you think you may have been infected with HIV or are at risk of contracting the virus, see a doctor as soon as possible.

Causes

HIV is caused by a virus,It can spread through sexual contact or blood, or from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breast-feeding.

How does HIV become AIDS?

HIV destroys CD4 T cells — white blood cells that play a large role in helping your body fight disease. The fewer CD4 T cells you have, the weaker your immune system becomes.

You can have an HIV infection, with few or no symptoms, for years before it turns into AIDS . AIDS is diagnosed when the CD4 T cell count falls below 200 or you have an AIDS -defining complication, such as a serious infection or cancer.

How HIV spreads

To become infected with HIV , infected blood, semen or vaginal secretions must enter your body. This can happen in several ways:

By having sex. You may become infected if you have vaginal, anal or oral sex with an infected partner whose blood, semen or vaginal secretions enter your body. The virus can enter your body through mouth sores or small tears that sometimes develop in the rectum or vagina during sexual activity.

The virus can enter your body through mouth sores or small tears that sometimes develop in the rectum or vagina during sexual activity. By sharing needles. Sharing contaminated IV drug paraphernalia (needles and syringes) puts you at high risk of HIV and other infectious diseases, such as hepatitis.

Sharing contaminated IV drug paraphernalia (needles and syringes) puts you at high risk of and other infectious diseases, such as hepatitis. From blood transfusions. In some cases, the virus may be transmitted through blood transfusions. American hospitals and blood banks now screen the blood supply for HIV antibodies, so this risk is very small.

During pregnancy or delivery or through breast-feeding. Infected mothers can pass the virus on to their babies. Mothers who are HIV -positive and get treatment for the infection during pregnancy can significantly lower the risk to their babies.

How HIV doesn't spread

You can't become infected with HIV through ordinary contact. That means you can't catch HIV or AIDS by hugging, kissing, dancing or shaking hands with someone who has the infection.

HIV isn't spread through the air, water or insect bites.

Risk factors

Anyone of any age, race, sex or sexual orientation can be infected with HIV / AIDS . However, you're at greatest risk of HIV / AIDS if you Have unprotected sex, These sores act as doorways for to enter your body. Use IV drugs. People who use IV drugs often share needles and syringes. This exposes them to droplets of other people's blood.

Complications

HIV infection weakens your immune system, making you much more likely to develop many infections and certain types of cancers Infections common to HIV/AIDS Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). This fungal infection can cause severe illness. Candidiasis is a common -related infection,Meningitis.

Prevention

There's no vaccine to prevent HIV infection and no cure for AIDS . But you can protect yourself and others from infection.

To help prevent the spread of HIV :

Use treatment as prevention , If you're living with HIV , taking HIV medication can keep your partner from becoming infected with the virus. If you make sure your viral load stays undetectable — a blood test doesn't show any virus — you won't transmit the virus to anyone else. Using TasP means taking your medication exactly as prescribed and getting regular checkups.

If you make sure your viral load stays undetectable — a blood test doesn't show any virus — you won't transmit the virus to anyone else. Using means taking your medication exactly as prescribed and getting regular checkups. Use post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) if you've been exposed to HIV . If you think you've been exposed through sex, needles or in the workplace, contact your doctor or go to the emergency department. Taking PEP as soon as possible within the first 72 hours can greatly reduce your risk of becoming infected with HIV . You will need to take medication for 28 days.

Use a new condom every time you have anal or vaginal sex. Women can use a female condom. If using a lubricant, make sure it's water-based. Oil-based lubricants can weaken condoms and cause them to break. During oral sex use a nonlubricated, cut-open condom or a dental dam — a piece of medical-grade latex.

Oil-based lubricants can weaken condoms and cause them to break. During oral sex use a nonlubricated, cut-open condom or a dental dam — a piece of medical-grade latex. Consider preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The combination drugs emtricitabine plus tenofovir (Truvada) and emtricitabine plus tenofovir alafenamide (Descovy) can reduce the risk of sexually transmitted HIV infection in people at very high risk. PrEP can reduce your risk of getting HIV from sex by more than 90% and from injection drug use by more than 70%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Descovy hasn't been studied in people who have receptive vaginal sex. Your doctor will prescribe these drugs for HIV prevention only if you don't already have HIV infection. You will need an HIV test before you start taking PrEP and then every three months as long as you're taking it. Your doctor will also test your kidney function before prescribing Truvada and continue to test it every six months. You need to take the drugs every day. They don't prevent other STIs , so you'll still need to practice safe sex. If you have hepatitis B, you should be evaluated by an infectious disease or liver specialist before beginning therapy.

It's important to tell all your current and past sexual partners that you're HIV -positive. They'll need to be tested.

It's important to tell all your current and past sexual partners that you're -positive. They'll need to be tested. Use a clean needle. If you use a needle to inject drugs, make sure it's sterile and don't share it. Take advantage of needle-exchange programs in your community. Consider seeking help for your drug use.

If you're pregnant, get medical care right away. If you're HIV -positive, you may pass the infection to your baby. But if you receive treatment during pregnancy, you can significantly cut your baby's risk.

If you're -positive, you may pass the infection to your baby. But if you receive treatment during pregnancy, you can significantly cut your baby's risk. Consider male circumcision. There's evidence that male circumcision can help reduce the risk of getting HIV infection.
